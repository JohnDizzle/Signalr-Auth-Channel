# Authchannel Message Board üó£Ô∏è

**Auth Channel** is a modern, open-source Blazor chat/message board application designed for secure, enterprise-ready collaboration. It leverages Azure services for authentication, real-time messaging, and file sharing.

‚ú® ## Features

 **Single-Tenant Authorization**  
  Uses [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) for secure, single-tenant authentication with Azure Active Directory.

‚úîÔ∏è **Real-Time Messaging**  
  Built on [Azure SignalR Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview) for scalable, low-latency chat.

‚úîÔ∏è **Room Ownership**  
  Users can create chat rooms and become their owners. Room owners manage the existance of there rooms.

‚úîÔ∏è **Private Messaging**  
  All messages are authorized per user/session. Private chats are supported with strict access control.

‚úîÔ∏è **File Sharing with Expiry**  
  Upload files to Azure Storage. Shared files are accessible via secure links that expire after 1 hour.

‚úîÔ∏è **Dependency Injection & Azure Common**  
  Built with .NET 9 and C# 13, using best practices for dependency injection and Azure SDKs.

‚úîÔ∏è **Session Management**  
  User sessions and message history are stored in Azure Table Storage for reliability and scalability.

üõû ## Architecture üõû

üìÉ **Frontend:** Blazor (.NET 9), Signalr Client
üìÉ **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, SignalR Management & Hub, Azure SDKs
üìÉ **Authentication:** Azure AD (MSAL, single-tenant)
üìÉ **Storage:** Azure Table Storage (sessions/messages), Azure Blob Storage (file uploads) - ** In Memory Storage is available for debugging **
üìÉ **Real-Time:** Azure SignalR Service

üî° ## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Azure Subscription (for SignalR, Storage, and AD)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend tooling, if needed)

### Configuration

1. **Azure AD App Registration**  
   Register a single-tenant app in Azure AD.  
   Update `appsettings.json` with your Azure AD and SignalR/Storage connection details.

2. **Azure Resources**  
   - Create an Azure SignalR Service instance.
   - Create an Azure Storage Account (Table + Blob).
   - Configure CORS and access policies as needed.

3. **Local Development**  
   - Run the application using `dotnet run` or your preferred IDE.
	 - Ensure you have the necessary Azure resources set up and configured in `appsettings.json`

4. **Environment Variables**  
   - `Azure:SignalR:ConnectionString`
   - `AzureAD:ClientSecret`
   - `AzureStorage`
   - `ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage`
   - `KeyVaultName`
   - *local development* you may add these to the secrets.json use the cli.
      1. dotnet user-secrets init .
      2. dotnet user-secrets set "Section:Key" "value".
      
		 **suggestion: use key vault for sensitive data**
  	
   - `Azure` - configuration in appsettings.json 
      ```
